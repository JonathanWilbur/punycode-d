A Punycode encoder and decoder based on the original implementation in [RFC 3492](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3492.txt), and [the JavaScript implementation by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/bestiejs/punycode.js). Originally written by Shotaro Yamada (@sinkuu), then very slightly improved by Jonathan M. Wilbur (@jonathanwilbur). Punycode is primarily used for converting URIs or IRIs containing non-ASCII characters into URIs or IRIs that are entirely ASCII, and vice versa. This is done because DNS is based on ASCII, so all DNS requests must be converted to ASCII before they can be processed.

## Usage

There are just two functions: punyEncode() and punyDecode().

### Encoding

Encode strings with the punyEncode() function:

```d
string unencoded = "ma単ana"; // a UTF-encoded string (notice the non-ASCII '単')
string encoded = punyEncode(unencoded); // encoded is now "maana-pta" (purely ASCII)
assert(encoded == "maana-pta"); // passes
```

### Decoding

Decode Punycode-encoded strings with the punyDecode() function:

```d
string encoded = "maana-pta"; // a Punycode-encoded string (purely ASCII)
string decoded = punyDecode(encoded); // decoded is now "ma単ana" (UTF)
assert(decoded == "ma単ana"); // passes
```

### Future Intent

I will be submitting this to the D Standard Library. If it does not get accepted
in principle (rather than in implementation), it will be published as a DUB package, 
and also incorporated into a D URL / URI Library, which will be submitted to the 
D Standard Library.
